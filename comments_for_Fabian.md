x Lovely abstract. Perhaps mention something about causality limitation.

x Use _italics_ for a new term, not quotes. So not "emergency savings".

x Opening sentence is causal: "helps its users..."

x philipps2021supporting unresolved reference

x make_s_ it easier

x one's need apostrophe I think

x p. 2 no comma before "which" - pretty sure one is needed here.

x Does rational inattention theory really predict that it makes people more likely to access information? Is this really a theory prediction or just common sense? - It's a theory prediction that is also common sense...

x The nascent literature... Useful to review whether these papers make good causal claims or just correlational.

x £100 and £150... per month? Over all six months? The former is a really large effect---worth mentioning this.

x Interestingly, users do not seem... So where does the £100-£150 go?

x p. 3. The first _no comma_ is the. And elsewhere

x p. 6. average person Carlin et al. (2019) Brackets

x observe _the_ user's

x "To the left of the observed period, this is because the app cannot access data before that point when the user signs up". Not true. The app does access data from before signup, but not indefinitely far back.

x Suppose classification is improved over time in MoneyDashboard. As you drop unclassified spends, this would mean you drop more spends earlier rather than later on?

x users _who_ have added

x annual income _after tax_, or _net_

x What are test users?

x Is it really the case that only a few percent of MDB users are using the app as we think it is intended, with their current account, credit card, and saving account all there so they can get an overview of their normal household finances. What are all the other 95% of users even doing on the platform? Is it really the case that almost everyone is doing something else on the platform? Let's discuss.

x When you drop unclassified transactions, what fraction of the count and spend is this?

x p. 10. Mention time period for income statistics. Monthly? - distribution for
2019

x What is _highly_ discretionary spend? highly?

x Dummies do not need subsequent columns in Table 2. Add units to make clear which are £ and which are counts.

x What does ATT stand for?

x What does the given $G_i=g$ mean? in Equation 1.

x Equation 2. Define $g'$. If $g$ is a group and $t$ is a time, you can't write $g'>t$ because you can't compare a group with a time.

x "encapsulates two main results". Assumptions not results?

x I struggled to follow the last part of Section 3.

x Why are CIs so much bigger for savings than for spend in Figure 4?

x "We can also see that in two periods, the null-hypothesis of identical pre-signup". Where can we see this?

x p. 16. Just finishes with "historical". More words needed!

x p. 17. So you mean that the reduced spend is channelled into many different destinations, and we do not have enough power to detect effects in any of them. But shouldn't there be a total outflow we can measure well enough? Or maybe there is just a change in the running balance (but this would be a one off)?

x How is Figure 6 panel A different to the basic result in Figure 4? Oh, it's a repeat. Say in caption.

x "food" might be called "eating out"?

x Check references. "Journal of _p_olitical Economy", "Journal of _m_onetary Economics"

Regression tables are needed I think, perhaps in an appendix. -- (Not adding them because they take a lot of work -- will take the risk that they won't be asked for!)
