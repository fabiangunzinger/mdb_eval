\subsection{Dynamic TWFE}%
\label{sub:dynamic_results}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dynamic_twfe}
    y_{it} = \sum^{5}_{s=-6} \beta_s D_{it}^s + \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \gamma X_{it} + \epsilon_{it},
\end{equation}

where $y_{it}$ is the outcome for individual $i$ at time $t$, $\alpha_i$ and
$\lambda_t$ are individual and year-month fixed effects, respectively, and
$X_{it}$ is a vector of individual and time varying controls. $D_{it}^s$ equals
1 if, in period $t$, individual $i$ is $s$ months away from signing up to the
app. The set of $\beta_s$ coefficients measure the effect of treatment $s$
periods away from treatment, which is what we are interested in.

To avoid multicollinearity issues and uniquely identify the lead and lag
effects, we omit relative period indicator $s = -1$, and bin the endpoints of our
observation window so that $D_{it}^{-6} = 1$ for all periods six or more
periods prior to signup and $D_{it}^{5} = 1$ for all months five or more months
after the month of signup. This expresses all estimates relative to the omitted
period, which -- given that it is the last month before signup -- serves as a
natural benchmark. Binning endpoints assumes that coefficients remain constant
outside the observation window. Both of these approaches are standard in the
literature, as discussed in \citet{sun2021estimating, schmidheiny2019event}.

% We omit the relative period indicator for period $s = -1$ because we need to
% omit one relative period indicator to avoid perfect collinearity among the
% period indicators, and we choose the last pre-treatment period because it
% serves as a natural benchmark against which to compare the outcomes in other
% periods.\footnote{As \citet{sun2021estimating} point out, there are two sources
% of perfect multicollinearity when estimating a fully dynamic model (i.e. one
% including all possible lags). The first results from all relative period
% indicators summing to 1 in each period, so that the entire set of relative period
% dummies across all time periods is perfectly multicollinear. We deal with this
% by excluding the indicator for $s = -1$. The second issue arises from the fact
% that for initial treatment period $E_i$, $t = s + E_i$. We deal with this issue
% by "trimming" our sample to be balanced in relative periods by only using
% data from relative periodl $\{-6, 5\}$. Both of these approaches are standard
% in the empirical literature.}

% \citet{sun2021estimating} define an event study design as a staggered adoption
% design where units are treated at different times and where there may or may
% not be never treated units. In our case, we have no never treated units, and
% treatment is absorbing in that once a unit is treated they will also be treated
% in all subsequent units.\footnote{We cannot rule out that some users who
% stopped using the app and closed their account rejoined later on, in which case
% they would appear in our dataset as a new user. However, we can plausibly
% assume that such cases are rare.} 

% Setup:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item We observe $N+1$ unites for $T+1$ periods and, for each
%         $i\in\{0,\ldots, N\}$ and $t\in\{0,\ldots,T\}$ observe outcome $y_{it}$
%         and treatment status $D_{it}\in\{0, 1\}$, where $D_{it}$ equals 1 if unit
%         $i$ is treated in period $t$ and 0 otherwise.

%     \item We can uniquely characterise treatment paths by the time period of
%         initial treatment, denoted as $E_i = min\{t: D_{it} = 1\}$.

%     \item We can group units into cohorts $e \in \{0,\ldots, T\}$, where units
%         in cohort $e$ were all first treated at time $e$, so that $\{i: E_i =
%         e\}$.

%     \item We define $y^e_{it}$ as the potential outcome in period $t$ if unit
%         $i$ was first treated in period $e$.

% \end{itemize}


% Assumptions:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Observations $\{y_{it}, D_{it}\}_{t=0}^T$ are independent.

%     \item A1: parallel trends: difference in baseline outcomes over time do
%         not differ between treatment cohorts. Not obviously violated in our
%         context. Early adopters might differ from late adopters, but difference
%         might plausibly be constant over time. - We don't have never treated
%         units, so Ashenfelter dip scenario is not a problem, even though we
%         seem to observe something like this in discretionary spending graph
%         (increase in disc spend before signup)

%     \item A2: no anticipatory behaviour. Plausibly violated if people are
%         motivated to save more and start doing so even before app use. Can test
%         for whether there is a peak prior to signup. Because our units have
%         private knowledge about future of treatment path (their intention to
%         reduce spending and save more and sign up to an app), this might be
%         violated. The trajectories of discret spend and net inflows are
%         conflicting on this, though, suggesting that they increases discret
%         spend in runup to app use (which might provide motivation to eventually
%         sign up) but also might have increased net savings slightly.

%     \item A3: treatment effect homogeneity across all cohorts and all relative
%         periods. (Note: treatment effects can be dynamic, but need to be the
%         same across cohorts). We could test for this.

% \end{itemize}


% Notes:
% \begin{itemize}

%     \item Comparison: pre vs post signup within each individual.

%     \item Assumption: there are no time-varying unobserved effects that affect
%         both y and D (formally: $E[Du] = 0$, since u is by definition
%         correlated with y.

%     \item Discussion: there is something that made the individual sign up in
%         the first place, and it might well be an individual level shock that we
%         don't observe (unexpected large expense, loss of job, exposure to
%         something that motivates saving or change in financial behaviour).

%     \item See \citet{imai2021use} for problems with twfe

\subsection{Subgroups}%
\label{sub:subgroups}

To analyse which groups benefit most from adopting Money Dashboard, we split
our sample by gender, generation, income quartiles, and pre-adoption savings
behaviour.

We define generations as follows: boomers were born between 1946 and 1964, Gen
X between 1965 and 1980, Millennials between 1981 and 1996, and Gen Z after
1997.\footnote{Based on age ranges provides by
    \href{https://www.beresfordresearch.com/age-range-by-generation/}{Beresford
Research}.}

Subgroup analysis: same Fig an Tab as in main analysis, but with line for each
subgroup. One figure for each of: gender, generations, income terciles,
per-adoption average savings tercile (inspired by \citet{carlin2017fintech},
see Fig 5 and Table 4).
