\subsection{Subgroups}%
\label{sub:subgroups}

To analyse which groups benefit most from adopting Money Dashboard, we split
our sample by gender, generation, income quartiles, and pre-adoption savings
behaviour.

We define generations as follows: boomers were born between 1946 and 1964, Gen
X between 1965 and 1980, Millennials between 1981 and 1996, and Gen Z after
1997.\footnote{Based on age ranges provides by

Subgroup analysis: same Fig an Tab as in main analysis, but with line for each
subgroup. One figure for each of: gender, generations, income terciles,
per-adoption average savings tercile (inspired by \citet{carlin2017fintech},
see Fig 5 and Table 4).
