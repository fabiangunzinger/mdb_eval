Limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can't say whether increase in savings was achieved by going into
        debt elsewhere

    \item Limitations: We have more data for users that signed up later. So average user in
        the study is not the average MDB user. If time of signup is mainly
        driven by financial savyness, then study sample is closer to overall
        population than MDB sample (if we rank groups as early joiners > late
        joiners > never joiners in terms of financial sophistication). If,
        however, signup reflects something like openness to newness, then it's
        not necessarily correlated with financial savyness. Either way, we
        might ignore it for now. We could test whether behaviour differs
        between early or late adopters, but that doesn't seem important enough.
