\section{Abstract}

In this paper, I test whether using Money Dashboard is associated with a
reduction in discretionary spending and an increase in emergency savings. I
find that users reduce their discretionary spend by between \pounds100 and
\pounds150 (11-17\% of average discretionary spend) once they start using the
app and sustain that reduction throughout the six-month post-signup period I
consider. In contrast, I cannot find an increase in short-term or long-term
savings. Looking at disaggregated measures of discretionary spend further
suggests that the reduction in spend is the result of maintained month-to-month
changes in behaviour rather than one-off cancellations of direct-debit
transactions, that it results from reductions across a number of spending
categories, and that it is a result of changes along the extensive rather than
the intensive margin -- users reduce the number of transactions they make
rather than the average transaction value. The two main limitations of my
approach that prevent me from interpreting my results as causal effects are the
self-selection into using Money Dashboard and the inability to disentangle the
effects of different features of the app.
